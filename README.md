# Advent of Code

## 2017

Done sometime in 2019. Out of curiosity I tried both Rust and C++ for a bunch of
these.

## 2018

First year of playing AoC on schedule. I used Python for most of the challenges,
and played around with some others.

## 2019

Current solutions in Rust. Trying to stick to the daily schedule of AoC.
