# Advent of Code

## 2016

A few solutions, mostly trying out some languages. Day 1 in RISC-V assembly was fun.

## 2017

Done sometime in 2019. Out of curiosity I tried both Rust and C++ for a bunch of
these.

## 2018

First year of playing AoC on schedule. I used Python for most of the challenges,
and played around with some others.

## 2019

Current solutions in Rust. Trying to stick to the daily schedule of AoC.

## 2020

I did not play in 2020 on schedule, but completed the tasks a year later in preparation for 2021. Ruby only.

## 2021

I made it to day 21 and then forgot about it ;)

## 2022

I'll play a bit in December, but most probably not all the way
