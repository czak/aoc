2017 day 4:
===========

CPP
---
liked:
- quite convenient tools for:
- sorting (sorted string in place)
- constructing a set from vector (just construct with {v.begin(), v.end()})
- liked count_if with my custom predicate
  - using a function pointer stopped working once i got to templates,
    but end result is still ok
    => actually got it to work but needed `is_valid<>`, so great after all
- quite easy to express concepts like hash & equality
- first time declaring a template, but it made sense and was quite easy
- nicely surprised by this:

```
vector<string> split(string s) {
  istringstream is {s};
  return {
    istream_iterator<string>{is},
    istream_iterator<string>{},
  }; // <-- this return is enough to construct a vector of words
}
```

didn't like:
- constantly have to add headers for every single class
- I had to declare both hash & equal types in order to get the "anagram equality"
  working; hard to find this in the documentation

missed:
- getline + vector.push_back is still the best way to read file
  line by line into vector
  - istream_iterator would only split by whitespace
  - decent solution with custom Line type: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1729772

overall:
- solution looks "clean" imho, feels quite functional too with count_if
  and the predicates and the equality & hash concepts
- surprised along the way with a few moments of "just works"


RUST
----
- functional style filter/map/split/collect feels more natural than CPP
- basics for splitting and filtering feel more "available", "at hand"
- it's more explicit about who owns what
  - in the CPP solution I must admit I don't know when things are moved,
    when they are copied, when I pass by reference etc
  - the Rust one makes it front and center
- I don't understand why the predicate bound got '&&Vec' (why two?)
  - and why it still seems to work? am I working on references to references?
  - makes me uneasy, but mostly because I don't know the ownership well enough yet
- difference:
  - cpp accepts a "quick-and-dirty" way, probably suboptimal in terms of references
    and/or copying; I don't really know who owns and how things are passed, but the end
    code compiles
  - Rust expects to get every last detail of this correct (and with specific rules)
    before it will even compile
- code in Rust looks messier
  - might be due to code highlighting - more colors on screen
  - type annotations
- devdocs for Rust not great
  - left pane unhelpful after narrowing down to a struct or a trait
  - will probably use default docs

liked:
- quick access to split_whitespace, collect, filter
- feels I'm importing less to get the same functionality

didn't like:
- tried same approach as CPP - implement custom hasher for HashSet, but
  somehow this felt harder than CPP

==========

RUST
----
- reading a file by lines still feels a bit wonky
- but getting the references and mutating the vector
  felt okay, I kind of knew where the & and where the *
  need to go
- I also often have the intuition that compiler won't
  allow something, but I save anyway to see the error
  message and confirm my assumption
- overall this was a very simple one
- indexes are usize, but there were negatives so I picked
  i32, but this means casts are needed a few times
  casts are still a bit weird to me

CPP
---
- reading number via cin >> num is very convenient
  but writing out via cout << << << feels like a chore
- surprised (positively I guess) by the warning
  when comparing int with vector size (comparing ints
  of different signedness)
- assigning a vector to another copies it
  this is convenient, but I still feel I don't know the pattern
  of copy/reference/value etc
  - I guess I'm thinking in java terms where every assignment
    is a reference (I think?)
  - also compared to Rust, an assignment is a move and you
    need to be explicit about copying
  - this gives CPP a head as a "quick and dirty" language
    but perhaps not great for a long term solution, not sure
- no easy way to print out larger structures for debugging
  (a'la Rust's "{:?}")
